# Gates

## Every change

```sh
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
cargo xtask layers      # crate layering and the no-UI-below-L6 rule (xtask/src/main.rs, LAYERS)
cargo xtask assets      # every bundled asset has a row in ATTRIBUTION.md
```

Other `xtask` commands: `cargo xtask wasm` (web build), `cargo xtask rt-targets` (cross-target check
of `crates/rt`; run it when you touch that crate), `cargo xtask ci` (the CI sequence).

## By area

| You touch | Also run or extend | What it proves |
|---|---|---|
| Anything the audio callback runs (`crates/mix`, `crates/playback`) | `crates/mix/tests/plan_alloc_probe.rs`, `alloc_probe.rs`, `event_alloc_probe.rs`; `measure` in `crates/rt/src/testing.rs` | Zero allocations per block, counted by a counting allocator. |
| Rendering, routing, PDC, sinks | `crates/mix/tests/plan_parity.rs` against `crates/mix/tests/golden/plan_parity`; `offline_plan_parity.rs`, `path_pdc.rs`, `output_sinks.rs` | The plan renderer matches the goldens; offline and realtime agree. |
| Sidechain keys | `crates/mix/tests/sidechain.rs`, `sidechain_hosted.rs` | Key tap, alignment, hosted keyed plug-ins. |
| Plug-in hosts | Fixture plug-ins behind the `test-hooks` cargo feature (`crates/clap-host`, `crates/vst3-host`); `crates/mix/tests/strip_panics*.rs` | Host behavior (threads, faults, teardown) without third-party plug-ins. |
| Playback timing, clocks, MIDI ingress, record start | The fake-device harness: `crates/playback/src/device_clock/tests.rs`, `crates/playback/tests/*.rs`, `crates/midi-io/src/fake.rs` | Timing logic under scripted device behavior, no hardware. |
| Session format | Load tests with old fixtures; `crates/engine/tests/hostile_sessions.rs` | Old sessions load; hostile input does not panic. |
| `crates/rt` (unsafe) | `cargo xtask rt-targets`, the platform legs of `.github/workflows/rt.yml`, a refutation review quoting every `unsafe` block | See `../knowledge/unsafe.md`. |
| UI | `crates/ui-studio/src/*_tests.rs`, the shortcut and icon guards | See `../knowledge/ui.md`. |

## Rules

- A gate that is not run is not a gate. If one cannot run on your machine, say so in the pull request.
- Do not weaken or delete a gate to make a change pass. Fix the cause (see `escape-record.md`).
- Tests must not load third-party plug-ins. Use the fixtures.
